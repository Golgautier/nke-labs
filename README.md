# Repository of some exercises to learn NKE (Nutanix Kubernetes Engine) and also Kubernetes

Here is the list of exercices available :

Useful resources :
* [Manifest models](./Manifest_models/)
* [Kubernetes official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
* [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a great tool to parse and interact with k8s clusters, instead of long `kubectl`commands.
